Future work
===========

In future we would like to:

- add support for MoveIt task constructor.
- adapt the code to work with other robots/grippers.
- add support for ROS2.
- add support for semantic grasps based on the future task.
  (e.g. grasp a powerdrill for handover vs drilling a hole after grasping).
